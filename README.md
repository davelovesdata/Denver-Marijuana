# Denver-Marijuana
This project is for Regis University, Master's program in Data Science. It is the Mapping of Denver Marijuana licenses and arrests. This is a work in progress and any comments are welcome.

Two .Rmd files are presented here: the first, denver_marijuana_full.Rmd, allows for direct download of the uncleaned datasets, cleaning, and graphical display. The second, denver_marijuana_short, uses the already cleaned files and focuses only on geocoding and graphically displaying the results.

The two .csv files are the cleaned files necessary for running the denver_marijuana_short.Rmd file.

A PDF document is also provided of the denver_marijuana_full.Rmd file, post execution.
