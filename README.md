# Denver-Marijuana
This project is for Regis University, Master's program in Data Science. It is the Mapping of Denver Marijuana licenses and arrests. This is a work in progress and any comments are welcome.

Two .Rmd files are presented here: 
1) denver_marijuana_full.Rmd allows for direct download of the uncleaned datasets, cleaning, and graphical display. 
2) denver_marijuana_short uses the already cleaned files and focuses only on geocoding and graphically displaying the results. Two .csv files are provided for running the denver_marijuana_short.Rmd file.

Any comments would be greatly appreciated.
